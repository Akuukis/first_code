# What is it?

It is two-player 'mortal combat' type game in 2D and 16 colors. It earned me 10 in school project at 7th grade.

# How to use?
I don't know. I haven't managed to run this since Windows XP. If you have Windows XP, just copy `EGAVGA.BGI` and `ISSTAA3.EXE` in the same folder and most of times just run it.

> I'd appreciate a pull-request on how to execute it on Linux, Windows 8 or Windows 10.

# History

In childhood I was dreaming about to make great games! This is my first game when I self-taugh programming at age 14 using laptop with 256 color display. Beware code style!

# Source code
Phew, looking back it looks bad. First of all, I should have learnt to read `.bmp` files instead of writing all graphical assets in arrays by hand.
